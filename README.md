# P2-InteractiveChart

Hello, here are the instructions for our git flow. Each individual person will be creating a branch for your feature. We will be dividing the class into 4 sub groups based on table. Each group will have one master branch which you will merge your files to. Your local admin will be responsible for merging once you are done. For this project, please do not change the base files (eg. Kilgore Trout). If you are closest to the door, you are group 1 and farthest is 4. Name your individual branch (insert group number)-LastFirst ex 4-RejoMichael. If you have anyone questions let us know! - Michael and Siri

TL;DR 
You can upload your files to a new branch. The group build masters will then merge your files to the master
